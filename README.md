# Build

ARM-GCC and Make are used for building the project. To build the project, type `make -f Builds/{Build_name}.mk` into terminal(CMD or PowerShell). Each build has its own build folder in `.builds` folder. Adding `-j{X}`, where `{x}` is number of jobs to create(~1.5 * number of CPU threads), will speed up the build process(eg., `make -f Builds/{Build_name}.mk -j48`). Every build will create `.bin` and `.hex` files(a.k.a. application executables) and copy them together with build `.map` file to `.outputs` folder.

It's possible to add different options to `make` command. Supported options are:
- `flash`: Flash the application onto MCU.
- `erase`: Erase application part in MCU flash.
- `erase_all`: Erase whole MCU flash.
- `reset`: Reset the MCU.
- `clean`: Delete the build folder from `.builds`, J-Link script files from `.jlink` folder and application executables from `.output` folder.
- `clean_jlink`: Delete J-Link script files from `.jlink` folder.
- `rtos_cfg`: Open the RTOS config file in CMSIS Config Wizard Java application.

### Structure

- **Build file**: Entry make file. Contains build specific config(eg., disabled debug, different optimization). Located in `Builds` folder.
- **Hardware file**: Make file with hardware configuration. Contains hardware-related files, defines etc.. Shared between all builds for same hardware. Located in `Hardware/{HW_name}` folder.
- **Application file**: Make file with application configuration. Contains application-related files, defines etc.. Shared between all builds. Located in `Config` folder.
- **Backend**: Make file with build process. Contains options for `make` command. Located in `Make` folder. Shared between all builds and does not contain application or hardware configuration.
- **Config**: Make file with configuration for build process. Located in `Make` folder. Shared between all builds and does not contain application or hardware configuration.

### Batch build

To do batch build, execute `BatchBuild.bat` batch script by typing `&.\BatchBuild.bat` to terminal.
To add new builds to batch build script, write make command as described above.
